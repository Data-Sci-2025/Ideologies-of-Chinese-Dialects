*Title*
Dialects reduce attractiveness?: A Study of Language Attitudes and Stereotypes toward Chinese Dialects on Social Media

*Background / Summary*
In China, although the official and national language is Putonghua (Standard Mandarin, literally translation: “the common language”, Shi, 2020), every region has its own dialect or language. However, due to the Putonghua Promotion Policy implemented in 1956, which requires people to use Mandarin in education, workplaces, and other formal settings (The State Council of the People’s Republic of China, 1956), regional dialects have gradually come to be perceived as less prestigious.

Recently, hashtags such as “speaking dialects affects attractiveness” and “dialects reduce sexual appeal” have become popular on Chinese social media. However, this perception does not apply to every Chinese language or dialect. Some varieties are considered pleasant-sounding, and people hope to learn them, while others are perceived as “rustic” or “funny.” Therefore, this study aims to explore how different Chinese varieties and accents are perceived on social media.

*Data collection*
The study will collect data from a video website called Bilibili, featured with danmu (literally translated as “bullet comments”). Bilibili has accessible API to certain users. Currently I am not eligible (because I cannot provide the company code), but I have emailed them and explained my purpose. Hope they would approve my request. 

Once I am able to access the data, I plan to select 4–6 major Chinese dialects and analyze the number of videos under each dialect, keywords in video titles, the intended purpose of the videos (e.g., language/culture spread, humor, etc.), the number of likes, and other relevant factors. Based on these analyses, I will draw conclusions about the ideologies associated with each Chinese variety.

*Unknowns*
However, if my request gets declined, is there any other method to retrieve the data?
